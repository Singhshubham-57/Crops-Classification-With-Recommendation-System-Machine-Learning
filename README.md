## Project Description
The objective of this project is to develop a crop classification system that can identify different crops based on their soil type and temperature. 
The system utilizes machine learning algorithms to train a model on a labeled dataset of crop images. The trained model can then predict the crop type for new input images.

In addition to crop classification, the project includes a recommendation system. Users can provide inputs such as geographical location, soil type, and climatic conditions to receive personalized crop recommendations. The recommendation system utilizes machine learning techniques to suggest suitable crops based on the given parameters.

Installation
To set up the project locally, follow these steps:

Models
The project utilizes machine learning models for crop classification and recommendation. Commonly used models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), Support Vector Machines (SVM), or Random Forests may be employed. Experiment with different models and evaluate their performance to determine the most suitable one for the task.

Dependencies
The project relies on the following dependencies:

Python 
scikit-learn 
pandas 
numpy 
matplotlib 
Make sure to have these dependencies installed in your environment before running the project.
